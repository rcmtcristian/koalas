          <h4> clueless</h4>
          <p>If you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat surface, the koala will not recognise it as
          food. They are too thick to adapt their feeding behaviour to cope with change. In a room full of potential food, they
          can literally starve to death.

          they do is eat, poop and occasionally scream like damn demons.

          <h4>why they suck</h4>
          <p>Many herbivorous mammals have adaptations to cope with harsh plant life taking its toll on their teeth, rodents for
          instance have teeth that never stop growing, some animals only have teeth on their lower jaw, grinding plant matter on
          bony plates in the tops of their mouths, others have enlarged molars that distribute the wear and break down plant
          matter more efficiently, Koalas are no exception. when their teeth erode down to nothing, they resolve the situation by starving to death, because they're fucking
          terrible animals

            <p>When the young joey needs to transition from rich, nourishing substances like milk, to eucalyptus (a plant that seems to
            be making it abundantly clear that it doesn't want to be eaten), it finds it does not have the necessary gut flora to
            digest the leaves. To remedy this, the young joey begins eating the feces from its mother's. This partially digested plant matter
            gives him just what he needs to start developing his digestive system. Of course, he may not even have needed to bother
            nuzzling his mother. She may have been suffering from incontinence. Why? Because koalas are riddled with chlamydia..</p>
